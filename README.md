# Instructions  

You are provided with two files: `index.html` and `style.css`. The one has the skeleton of an HTML file and all of its content. It will render and be a complete page. Your job is to make that web page look like this:

![Finished Web page](assets/fairytale.png)

Use any references and search engines you can to locate rules that will replicate the image. Work carefully and try to think about one element at a time until it all comes together. Refresh the rendered page often to see what changes do. Play around and experiment and see what works and what doesn't.
